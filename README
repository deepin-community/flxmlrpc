Features

    Easy     This library is easy to incorporate into C++ applications. No other
             libraries are required, other than your system's socket libraries.
             Simple XML parsing and HTTP support are built in.

    Fast     All IO is non-blocking, so a slow client or network will not slow
             down the server.

    Portable Written in standard C++ to the POSIX and Windows sockets APIs.
             You do need a fairly recent compiler, g++ 3.1 or greater.

    Free     This library is released under the GNU LGPL.
