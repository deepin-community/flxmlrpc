flxmlrpc release notes

Ported from xmlrpcpp by Chris Morley

1. Better handling of fault responses: server methods can throw an
   Fl_XmlRpcException to return a fault and Fl_XmlRpcClient has a new method
   to test whether the last response was a fault.

2. Support for system.listMethods and system.methodHelp from the introspection
   API.

3. Support for system.multicall to process multiple requests in a single
   transaction.

4. Doxygen comments in header file, with Doxyfile to create html docs in the
   include direcotry.
